    "During my screen design training in January, I learned how to use Sketch more extensively and practiced designing according to design principles of Material Design and the User Interface Guidelines. This ultimately led to the app design of Ropeless, a platform for boulderers who want to connect to climbing gyms in Europe.",

    "Using a rough concept, scribbles and wireframes, I framed my design decisions for the main screens and ultimately the prototype.",
    "The idea: ",
    `Young athletes who originally belong to the new indoor climbing generation use "Ropeless" to discover and connect to new climbing gyms. Guided by social and ambitious motives, their desire to connect to places should be seen as important as their wish to self-profile and identify with their home gym. However, the focus remains on finding a well-rated gym that can be found on the next business trip or vacation.`,
    "A perfect match: boulder and travel in the urban life ðŸ’›",
    "Styleguide of Ropeless",
    "The essential features according to target group and type of use affect all main screens equally. You want to create a differentiated bouldering profile (preferences, skills, favorite gyms, favorite products e.g. shoes, chalk brands), as well as be able to provide travel-useful gym information, which is community-based and visible without private advertising. When searching for a gym, the focus is on the clear UI and filters, which reflect the searchers' most important criteria.",
    "To make handover to the devs easier, the components, colors, styles and layers were created in Sketch and clearly compiled in a styleguide.",
    "Final conceptual thoughts for the basic design of the application came during the further planning process. I chose an app and not a website as a travel-supporting tool and for the mobile application in the gym. When used during gym opening hours and travel times, I selected light mode as default.",
    "Although some information can be given about one's own climbing preferences and abilities, Ropeless should be clearly distinguishable from a social media platform. In addition to the evaluation function, a comment function is intended to create freedom for critical discussion of the sports facilities. The app does not display any other social media content. It should only be possible to link to the hall channels via links.",
    "Please watch a demo of the prototype and ",
    "feel free to tell me",
    " what you think about it."
